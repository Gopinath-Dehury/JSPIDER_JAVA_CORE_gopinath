 4. What is CascadeType.ALL?
It means any operation (persist, merge, remove, refresh, detach) applied to the parent entity will also be applied to the associated child entity.

✅ Example:
java
Copy
Edit
@OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
private Engine engine;
If you do:

java
Copy
Edit
em.persist(car);
➡️ Hibernate will also persist(car.getEngine()) automatically.
Useful when saving/removing associated objects.
